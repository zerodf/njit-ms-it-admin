# University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana

My first advanced degree was in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana.  

I worked on zooplankton in the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) under Dr. John Chick of the [Illinois Natural History Survey](http://www.inhs.illinois.edu/) (INHS).  It was actually a very interesting project and we found some evidence to confirm what some of the founders of the INHS had hypothesized over a century ago!

That being said, I didn't want to create a whole new repository for any code I wrote during this period.  First, I am not quite sure of the ownership.  Second, the API for creating the geoprocessor objects has changed significantly since 2006!  

However, there might be interesting writings worth preserving.
