## Information Systems 631: Enterprise Database Management

This directory is to hold interesting bits of code I develop for IS631 Enterprise database management.  This course focuses on management and implementation of databases as an enterprise resource.  

Note: I will rigourously uphold the [NJIT Code of Academic Integrity](https://www.njit.edu/policies/sites/policies/files/academic-integrity-code.pdf) in reference to submissions here.  In other words, I am not here to provide you with easily plagerized code to help with your homework.  However, I will also fight for my rights to freedom of expression.
