A catch all repository for code I have written as a master's student at NJIT.  

I am currently enrolled in the [M.S. in Information Technology Administration and Security](http://catalog.njit.edu/graduate/computing-sciences/information-technology/administration-security-ms/).  As you can see from the link, this program offers a broad background in IT related operations.
